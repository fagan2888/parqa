## GENERAL TODO

- 311 complains park name ontology
- POSTGRES/MONGO Database
- Recognize park district for each complain
- show total and timeline of complains for each district normalised by park area
- geolocate calls for parks
- functional area for each park <-- geolocation of calls (of ~6 mln calls)


- we have time series now, so we can do timeseries clustering, or compare time series per park to quality time (need accseries
- I can compare complainds distribution to quailty distribution per park (ks-test)
